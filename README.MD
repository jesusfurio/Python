On this repository you can check my practices on Python. Additionally I will be adding new scripts created of my day to day.

**List**
1. *exercism* --> On this folder I save different exercise from website exercism.io. Each exercise contains its own explanation.
2. *commercialgesture.py* --> This scripts calculate prorrated days between two service. 
3. *epoch.py* --> Script to convert date to epoch value.
4. *servicetest.py* --> Script to execute different test for network, web and mail service.
